# TokenLense Visualization Framework Development Progress

## Current Phase: Implementation of Basic Visualizations

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Analyzed API documentation (openapi_export_20251104.json)
- [x] Reviewed token attribution schema (get_attribution_endpoint.md)
- [x] Examined existing visualization components (WordCloud.tsx, TokenExplorer.tsx)
- [x] Created comprehensive project understanding document
- [x] Created architecture design document
- [x] Created implementation blueprint
- [x] Defined TypeScript interfaces for API responses
- [x] Enhanced API client to handle all required endpoints
- [x] Created utility functions for data transformation
- [x] Implemented basic application structure and routing
- [x] Built model and method selection interfaces
- [x] Created basic version of TokenCloud component

### In-Progress Tasks
- [ ] Enhancing the TokenCloud visualization with more features
- [ ] Implementing method comparison visualization
- [ ] Adding context window adjustment functionality
- [ ] Creating additional visualizations (matrix view)

### Upcoming Tasks
- [ ] Add model comparison with split view
- [ ] Implement performance metrics visualization
- [ ] Create detailed attribution matrix heatmap
- [ ] Add token importance chart
- [ ] Implement interactive help/documentation

### Blockers/Questions
1. Need to test the application with real API data to verify it works correctly
2. Need to confirm how to best implement method comparison with color differentiation
3. Need to explore how to efficiently handle large attribution matrices
