# TokenLense Implementation Summary

## Project Overview

We've developed a comprehensive visualization framework for exploring token attribution data from language models. The application allows researchers and developers to understand how language models make generation decisions by visualizing the relationships between input and output tokens.

## Core Components Implemented

1. **Application Structure**
   - Next.js 15 with App Router architecture
   - TypeScript for type safety throughout
   - Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
   - Responsive layout with header/footer

2. **Data Management**
   - Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for API responses
   - Complete API client with error handling
   - Data transformation utilities
   - Type-safe approach throughout

3. **Navigation and Selection**
   - Model selection interface
   - Method selection for each model
   - File selection for each method
   - Breadcrumb navigation system

4. **TokenCloud Visualization**
   - Token rendering with proper formatting
   - Interactive connections between tokens
   - Token importance visualization
   - Background highlighting for relationships

5. **User Controls**
   - Connection count adjustment
   - Visualization toggles (background, connections, importance)
   - Aggregation method selection
   - Context window size adjustment

## Components in Detail

### 1. Model Selection Page
- Displays available models with metadata
- Clean, card-based layout for easy selection
- Error handling for API issues
- Loading states for better user experience

### 2. Method Selection Page
- Shows attribution methods for selected model
- Provides method descriptions
- Consistent navigation and breadcrumbs
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes

### 3. File Selection Page
- Lists attribution files with metadata
- Shows prompts and timestamps when available
- Clean, ordered presentation
- Navigation back to methods

### 4. Attribution Visualization Page
- Shows prompt and generated text
- Displays token visualization
- Provides aggregation method selection
- Shows matrix information and metadata

### 5. TokenCloud Component
- Visualizes source and target tokens
- Shows connections between related tokens
- Calculates and displays token importance
- Supports interaction with hover and click

### 6. TokenExplorer Component
- Wraps TokenCloud with controls
- Provides sliders for connection count
- Includes toggles for visualization options
- Handles interaction state management

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Method Comparison**
   - Toggle between multiple attribution methods
   - Color-coded visualization of different methods
   - Combined view showing overlapping attributions

2. **Context Window Enhancement**
   - Improved context window adjustment
   - Sliding/panning through larger token sequences
   - Focus+context visualization for large matrices

3. **Model Comparison**
   - Split view for comparing multiple models
   - Synchronized navigation between models
   - Difference highlighting

4. **Additional Visualizations**
   - Matrix heatmap visualization
   - Token importance charts
   - Performance metric visualizations

## Technical Implementation

The architecture follows best practices for modern React applications:
- Component-based design for reusability
- Custom hooks for data fetching and state management
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Progressive enhancement for interactivity
- Type safety with TypeScript interfaces

## Documentation

We've created comprehensive documentation:
- Project understanding document
- Architecture design document
- Implementation blueprint
- Progress tracking
- Enhancement plans
- README with setup and usage instructions

## Conclusion

The implemented solution provides a solid foundation for exploring token attribution data. The visualization components are flexible, interactive, and can be extended with additional features. The application is built with scalability in mind, allowing for future enhancements and additional visualization types.
